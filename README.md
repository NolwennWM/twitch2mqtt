<H1>PURPOSE</H1>

Let your Twitch chat sends MQTT messages to your broker and mess with your domotic. Probably a bad idea, but could be very fun.
Download the twitch.js example file and edit it to your needs.

<H1>REQUIEREMENTS</H1>

NodeJS and NPM.

Then install 'tmi.js' and 'mqtt' modules with NPM.

You can also use a ready to use Docker container here: https://hub.docker.com/r/malantp/twitch2mqtt
